# To-do task manager

Hey everyone! This is my first flutter project that I am uploading. If anyone has any suggestions or something to talk about feel free to contact me :)



This project is a starting point for a Flutter application for me.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- the app automatically changes its theme matching your own devices (pretty cool in my opinion)
- This is a basic cross platform application to manage your daily tasks like buying groceris or completing homework. 
- You can add new tasks, delete tasks or mark them as completed
